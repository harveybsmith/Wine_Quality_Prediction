# Wine_Quality_Prediction

This project was aimed at using a dataset of 1600 kinds of wine and various independent variables such as:
	fixed acidity,	volatile acidity,	citric acid,	residual sugar,	chlorides,	free sulfur dioxide,	total sulfur dioxide,	density,	pH,	sulphates,	alcohol
  and then using them to predict the ordinal value 'quality' dependent (y) variable.  I chose a  linear regression model and backpropogation to fine tune the model repeatedly.
  
RESULTS:
0.987 r sqaured value
